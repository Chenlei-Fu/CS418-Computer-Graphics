# MP2: Terrain Modeling

For your second Machine Problem, you will procedurally model a piece of terrain.

* The terrain will be finite…do not be concerned about being able to see the boundary.
* The scene will be static…meaning you will not interactively change your view of it/
* We will add interaction in a following MP, so write good code that you can reuse.

### Development Timeline
* 03/04
  Set up initial folder

  Finish `generateTriangles()` , `getVertex` and `setVertex` in Terrain.js

* 03/13

  Finish `shapeTerrain()` 

* 03/14

  Use `gl.drawElements` ?? It seems we don't need to change it

  Complete `calculateNormals()` in Terrain.js

* 03/16

  Implement a perspective view in MP2.js

  Implement the Phong reflection model and Phong Shading
