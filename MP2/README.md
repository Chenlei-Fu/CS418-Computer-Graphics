# MP2: Terrain Modeling

For your second Machine Problem, you will procedurally model a piece of terrain.

* The terrain will be finite…do not be concerned about being able to see the boundary.
* The scene will be static…meaning you will not interactively change your view of it/
* We will add interaction in a following MP, so write good code that you can reuse.
