### Parsing an OBJ File
You only need to implement a reader that parses a subset of the full OBJ format. You just need to handle the tags f, v and #.

Use the above linked teapot model, which consists only of vertices and triangular faces. Load the vertices into a vertex position array, and the triangle faces into a face array whose elements are triples of vertex indices. **Note that the indices of the vertices in the OBJ start at 1**. This means you will need to adjust them assuming your arrays start indexing at 0. You will need to create per-vertex normals for the mesh as well, which you should compute as the average normal of the the triangles incident on the vertex.

##### Implementation
You should complete the function `loadFromOBJ(fileText)` in the file `TriMesh.js`. You will likely find the JS string method split useful. A robust way to split handling white space is to use the separator.

### Texture Mapping
Now we will load an image to use as a texture and send it to the fragment shader as a uniform. You can use the file brick.jpg or a different image if you wish.

### Generating Texture Coordinates

In the shader, we need to generate texture coordinates at each fragment and use those to map into the image and sample a color. One way to do this would be to have the JS code use some mathematical function mapping between the mesh shape and the rectangular image to generate per-vertex texture coordinates. High quality texture mapping will often take this approach, using shape specific texture coordinates for the model that were generated by an artist.

### Phong Shading 

You should shade the color sampled from the texture so that it looks like it is really in the 3D scene you are drawing. This means that you should use the sampled color `texColor.rgb` from the texture in place of `kAmbient` and `kDiffuse` in the reflection modelâ€¦effectively making it the material color. Since specular highlights are usually white, it would make sense to keep `kSpecular` as white. Once this is in place you should see something like this:



### User Interaction Using a Mouse 

The model should rotate around the Y (up) axis if a mouse button is being held down and the mouse moves in the X direction.
